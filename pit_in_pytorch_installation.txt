1. Assume that you have already make "cuda driver" run well on your computer.
   $nvidia-smi
   you can see the status of your nvidia.
2. get the newest Anaconda
   Unbuntu:
   $sudo apt-get install Anaconda
3. load into the offical website of Pytorch, copy the code to your terminal.
4. if things go well, you can use pytorch now.
   type in: 
   $ipython
   $import torch # attention that you'd better leave the pytorch folder
   $import torch.nn as nn
5. if you want to update Pytorch because you find the newest feature on Github.
   clone the package into your computer and run command:
   $python setup.py build install #remember that the python version should be related to Anaconda. Like this: Python 3.6.0 | Anaconda custom(64-bit). So that the computer will know that you want to update it.

However, thing will not go well at this step, I met these problems
1). It needs the gnu version lower than 5
	I uninstall my gnu6 and reinstalled 4.9. Do remember to link /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 to /usr/bin/gcc, like this
	$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-(your version) /usr/bin/gcc
2). It cannot find "cuda.h"
	I add these to my ./.bashrc
	$export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda # for ubuntu
	$export CUDA_HOME=/opt/cuda # for archlinux. (dependents on where you install your cuda)
	$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=â€œLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64"
3). Some other strange errors
	Update my cuda......
	UPdate my Anaconda......
	Sort for help on the forum of Pytorch.

Pardon my poor English.
That's all.
